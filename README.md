# Hustler

Idle clicker game inspired by Adventure Capitalist.

------------

#### Brief Overview:
In this game, players will start as a small-time investor and work their way up to become a successful business owner by investing in a variety of businesses and earning income. As they progress, players can upgrade their businesses to increase their income and unlock new ones.

One of the unique features of my clicker game is its idle gameplay, which allows players to earn money even when they are not actively playing the game. This makes it a great option for players who enjoy casual gaming or don't have a lot of time to devote to a game.
